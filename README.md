# LUS-COVID-CHALLENGE
## Introduction  

[Lung ultrasound (LUS) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q0cTG3ZlHk&amp;ab_channel=MedCram-MedicalLecturesExplainedCLEARLY)is a non-invasive, pragmatic and time-tested tool for evaluating and discriminating respiratory pathology at the bedside. Indeed, when LUS is interpreted by *expert* clinicians, its predictive accuracy can match CT scanners. Recently, ultrasound-on-a-chip technology has made LUS extremely portable ([pluggable into a mobile phone](https://www.butterflynetwork.com/uk/)) and cheap enough (2000USD vs 30,000USD+) for use in resource limited settings. This makes it particularly useful in COVID-19, where its portability enables decentralized respiratory evaluations (at home or in triage centers rather than in the hospital) and simple inter-patient disinfection.  However, while acquisition may be simple, interpretation is comparatively challenging, prone to subjective bias as well as a lack of standardization.  The challenge is to use deep learning methods to predict if a patient has COVID-19 based on the LUS images!
